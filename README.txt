The values in the file _data/input/parameters.txt correspond to the following variables:
 - measures : Number of measures taken
 - N : discretization depth
 - eta : lattice step in units of 1/omega
 - decorrel_len : distance between measures in units of Metropolis calls
 - thermal_len : guess for the number of steps required for the oscillator to reach equilibrium
 - delta_metro : maximum variation during the Metropolis algorithm (may also use sqrt(eta))
 - init_flag : determines the starting state of the oscillator
 - resamplings : number of resamplings taken during bootstrap algorithm
